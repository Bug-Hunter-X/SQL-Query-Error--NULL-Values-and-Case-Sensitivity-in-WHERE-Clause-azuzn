This repository demonstrates a common SQL query error related to handling NULL values and case sensitivity in the WHERE clause.  The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous query, while `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises when dealing with columns that might contain NULL values or have inconsistent capitalization, leading to incomplete or inaccurate query results. The README file provides detailed explanations and potential solutions.
